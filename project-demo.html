        <p class="centerAlign"> This project will focus on creating
            a e-commerce clothing website in order to showcase
            and incorporate
            a wide variety of features from HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            Most Notably, I hope to include the following:
        </p>

        <ul class="centerAlign">
            <li>Fully Functional Shopping Cart.</li>
            <li>Payment Method.</li>
            <li>Shipping, Taxes, and Total Price Calculated.</li>
            <li>Email Subscription Section.</li>
            <li>Modern, streamlined style.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="centerAlign">
            After talking with other people within ravine, I finalized
            a clothing website due to the fact that there are a lot of 
            different things that can be learned and encorporated into the site.<br>
            An e-commerce site is also very common within industries and share many elements that can be 
            used in other sites as well.
            It fully utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript which will<br>
            give me the ability to get me more up close and personal with
            web development as a whole.
